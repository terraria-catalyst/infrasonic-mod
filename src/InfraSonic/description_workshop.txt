The InfraSonic mod allows you and your friends to chat via voice directly in Terraria, with no need for any third-party software!

Some of this mod's features:
- Background Music Ducking, which automatically lowers the volume of the game's background music when someone is speaking.
- Proximity Chat, which introduces a positional effect to voices, and the closer the player, the louder the voice.
- Noise Suppression, to filter out unwanted background sounds.
- Sound occlusion and reverb support with Terraria Overhaul and Terraria Ambience.

How to use:
1. Subscribe to this Mod.
2. Enter the game, go to "Controls", scroll to the bottom, and set a keybind for "Open Voice Control Panel".
3. Pressing this opens the control panel, which can be used to configure all aspects of the voice chat.
